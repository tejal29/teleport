title: Monitor Teleport Audit Events with Splunk
description: How to configure Teleport's Event Handler plugin to send audit events to Splunk
---

Teleport's Event Handler plugin receives audit events from the Teleport Auth
Service and forwards them to your log management solution, letting you perform
historical analysis, detect unusual behavior, and form a better understanding of
how users interact with your Teleport cluster.

In this guide, we will show you how to configure Teleport's Event Handler plugin
to send your Teleport audit events to Splunk. In this setup, the Event Handler
plugin forwards audit events from Teleport to Splunk's Universal Forwarder,
which stores them in Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise for
visualization and alerting. 

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Linux host where you will run the Teleport Event Handler plugin and Splunk
  Universal Forwarder. The Universal Forwarder must be installed on the host
  already.

  <Details title="Running the Event Handler and Universal Forwarder on separate
  hosts">

  If you run the Event Handler and Universal Forwarder on the same host, there
  is no need to open a port on the host for ingesting logs. However, if you run
  the Universal Forwarder on a separate host from the Event Handler, you will
  need to open a port on the Universal Forwarder host to traffic from the Event
  Handler. This guide assumes that the Universal Forwarder is listening on port
  `8888`.

  </Details>

- Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise v9.0.1 or above. On Splunk
  Enterprise, port `9997` should be open to traffic from the host running the
  Teleport Event Handler and Universal Forwarder.

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Set up the Event Handler plugin

The Event Handler plugin is a binary that runs independently of your Teleport
cluster. It authenticates to your Teleport cluster and your Splunk Universal
Forwarder using mutual TLS. In this section, you will install the Event Handler
plugin on the Linux host where you are running your Universal Forwarder and
generate credentials that the plugin will use for authentication.

### Install the Event Handler plugin

Follow the instructions for your environment to install the Event Handler plugin
on your Universal Forwarder host:

<Tabs dropdownCaption="Method" dropdownSelected="Executable">
  <TabItem options="Executable" label="Latest Release">

  On the host where you are running the Universal Forwarder, execute the
  following commands:

  ```code
  $ curl -L -O https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-event-handler-v(=teleport.plugin.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  $ tar -zxvf teleport-event-handler-v(=teleport.plugin.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  ```

  Move the `teleport-event-handler` binary into your `PATH`.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem options="Docker" label="Latest Release ">

  On the host where you are running the Universal Forwarder, execute the
  following command:

  ```code
  $ docker pull public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-plugin-event-handler:(=teleport.plugin.version=)
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem options="Docker" label="From Source">
  You must have Docker Desktop installed on your Universal Forwarder host. 

  Log in to the host and execute the following commands to build the plugin:

  ```code
  $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git --depth 1
  $ cd teleport-plugins/event-handler/build.assets
  $ make build
  ```

  You can find the compiled binary within your clone of the `teleport-plugins`
  repo, with the file path, `event-handler/build/teleport-event-handler`. Move
  this into your `PATH`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem options="Executable" label="From Source ">

  You will need Go >= (=teleport.golang=) installed.

  Run the following commands on your Universal Forwarder host:

  ```code 
  $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git --depth 1
  $ cd teleport-plugins/event-handler
  $ go build
  ```

  The resulting executable will have the name `event-handler`. To follow the
  rest of this guide, rename this file to `teleport-event-handler` and move it
  into your `PATH`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Generate a starter config file

Generate a configuration file with placeholder values for the Teleport Event
Handler plugin. Later in this guide, we will edit the configuration file for
your environment.

On the host where you are running the Universal Forwarder and the Event Handler
plugin, execute the following command to generate a sample configuration that we
will edit later. Replace `mytenant.teleport.sh` with the DNS name of your
Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport Cloud tenant:

```code
$ teleport-event-handler configure . mytenant.teleport.sh
```

The `teleport-event-handler configure` command generates several files that you
will refer to when generating credentials for the plugin and configuring the
Universal Forwarder:

|File(s)|Purpose|
|---|---|
| `ca.crt` | Self-signed CA certificate that the Event Handler plugin and the Universal Forwarder will use to validate one another's TLS certificates.|
| `server.crt` and `server.key`| TLS certificate and key for the Universal Forwarder.|
| `client.crt` and `client.key`| TLS certificate and key for the Event Handler plugin.|
| `teleport-event-handler-role.yaml`| `user` and `role` resource definitions for the Event Handler plugin.|
| `fluent.conf`| Fluentd configuration file. We will use parts of this to configure the Universal Forwarder.|
| `teleport-event-handler.toml` | Starter configuration file for the Event Handler plugin.|
| `ca.key` | Not used in this setup. |

### Define RBAC resources

The `teleport-event-handler configure` command generated a file called
`teleport-event-handler-role.yaml`. This file defines a `teleport-event-handler`
role and a user with read-only access to the `event` API:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: teleport-event-handler
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['event', 'session']
        verbs: ['list','read']
version: v5
---
kind: user
metadata:
  name: teleport-event-handler
spec:
  roles: ['teleport-event-handler']
version: v2
```

Move this file to your workstation (or recreate it by pasting the snippet above)
and use `tctl` on your workstation to create the role and the user:

```code
$ tctl create -f teleport-event-handler-role.yaml
# user "teleport-event-handler" has been created
# role 'teleport-event-handler' has been created
```

### Enable impersonation of the Event Handler plugin user

In order for the Event Handler plugin to forward events from your Teleport
cluster, it needs signed credentials from the cluster's certificate authority.
The `teleport-event-handler` user cannot request this itself, and requires
another user to **impersonate** this account in order to request credentials.

Create a role that enables your user to impersonate the `teleport-event-handler`
user. First, paste the following YAML document into a file called
`teleport-event-handler-impersonator.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: teleport-event-handler-impersonator
spec:
  options:
    # max_session_ttl defines the TTL (time to live) of SSH certificates
    # issued to the users with this role.
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  # This section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. By default nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    impersonate:
      users: ["teleport-event-handler"]
      roles: ["teleport-event-handler"]
```

Next, create the role:

```code
$ tctl create teleport-event-handler-impersonator.yaml
```

Assign this role to your Teleport user by running the following commands,
depending on whether you authenticate as a local Teleport user or via the
`github`, `saml`, or `oidc` authentication connectors: 

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Local User">

Retrieve your local user's configuration resource:

```code
$ tctl get users/$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') > out.yaml
```

Edit `out.yaml`, adding `teleport-event-handler-impersonator` to the list of
existing roles.

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f out.yaml
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="GitHub">

Retrieve your `github`  configuration resource:

```code
$ tctl get github/github > github.yaml
```

Edit `github.yaml`, adding `teleport-event-handler-impersonator` to the
`teams_to_roles` section. The team you will map to this role will depend on how
you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the smallest team
possible within your organization. This team must also include your user.

Here is an example:

```diff
  teams_to_roles:
    - organization: octocats 
      team: admins 
      roles:
        - access
+       - teleport-event-handler-impersonator
```

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f github.yaml
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="SAML">

Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

```code
$ tctl get saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
```

Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `teleport-event-handler-impersonator` to the
`attributes_to_roles` section. The attribute you will map to this role will
depend on how you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the
smallest group possible within your organization. This group must also include
your user.

Here is an example:

```diff
  attributes_to_roles:
    - name: "groups" 
      value: "my-group" 
      roles:
        - access
+       - teleport-event-handler-impersonator
```

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f saml.yaml
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="OIDC">

Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:

```code
$ tctl get oidc/myoidc > oidc.yaml
```

Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `teleport-event-handler-impersonator` to the
`claims_to_roles` section. The claim you will map to this role will depend on
how you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the smallest
group possible within your organization. This group must also include your
user.

Here is an example:

```diff
  claims_to_roles:
    - name: "groups" 
      value: "my-group" 
      roles:
        - access
+       - teleport-event-handler-impersonator
```

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f saml.yaml
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Log out of your Teleport cluster and log in again to assume the new role.

### Export the access plugin identity

Like all Teleport users, `teleport-event-handler` needs signed credentials in
order to connect to your Teleport cluster. You will use the `tctl auth sign`
command to request these credentials for the plugin. 

<ScopedBlock scope={["enterprise", "oss"]}>

The format of the credentials depends on whether you have set up your network to
give the plugin direct access to the Teleport Auth Service, or if all Teleport
clients and services connect to the Teleport Proxy Service instead.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Connect to the Proxy Service">

The following `tctl auth sign` command impersonates the `access-plugin` user,
generates signed credentials, and writes an identity file to the local
directory:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user=teleport-event-handler --out=auth.pem
```

The Event Handler plugin listens for audit events by connecting to the Teleport
Auth Service's gRPC endpoint over TLS.

The identity file, `auth.pem`, includes both TLS and SSH credentials. Your
Event Handler plugin uses the SSH credentials to connect to the Proxy Service,
which establishes a reverse tunnel connection to the Auth Service. The plugin
uses this reverse tunnel, along with your TLS credentials, to connect to the
Auth Service's gRPC endpoint.

You will refer to this file later when configuring the plugin.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Connect to the Auth Service">

If your network allows your plugin to access the Auth Service directly, e.g.,
you are running the plugin on the Auth Service host, the plugin uses TLS
credentials to connect to the Auth Service's gRPC endpoint and listen for audit
events.

You can generate TLS credentials with the following command:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --format=tls --user=teleport-event-handler --out=auth
```

This command should result in three PEM-encoded files: `auth.crt`,
`auth.key`, and `auth.cas` (certificate, private key, and CA certs
respectively). Later, you will configure the plugin to use these credentials to
connect to the Auth Service.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</ScopedBlock>

<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">

The following `tctl auth sign` command impersonates the `teleport-event-handler`
user, generates signed credentials, and writes an identity file to the local
directory:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user=teleport-event-handler --out=auth.pem
```

Teleport's Event Handler plugin listens for new and updated audit events by
connecting to the Teleport Auth Service's gRPC endpoint over TLS.

The identity file, `auth.pem`, includes both TLS and SSH credentials. The Event
Handler plugin uses the SSH credentials to connect to the Proxy Service, which
establishes a reverse tunnel connection to the Auth Service. The plugin uses
this reverse tunnel, along with your TLS credentials, to connect to the Auth
Service's gRPC endpoint.

You will refer to this file later when configuring the plugin.

</ScopedBlock>

Move the credentials you generated to the host where you are running the Event
Handler plugin.

<Admonition
  title="Certificate Lifetime"
>

  By default, `tctl auth sign` produces certificates with a relatively short
  lifetime. For production deployments, you can use the `--ttl` flag to ensure a
  more practical certificate lifetime, e.g., `--ttl=8760h` to export a one-year
  certificate.

</Admonition>

## Step 2/4. Configure the Universal Forwarder

{/*TODO: Add instructions for configuring the Universal Forwarder*/}

## Step 3/4. Run the Event Handler plugin

### Complete the Event Handler configuration

Earlier, we generated a file called `teleport-event-handler.toml` to configure
the Event Handler plugin. This file includes settings similar to the following:

```toml
storage = "./storage"
timeout = "10s"
batch = 20
namespace = "default"

[forward.fluentd]
ca = "/home/ca.crt"
cert = "/home/client.crt"
key = "/home/client.key"
url = "https://localhost:8888/test.log"

[teleport]
addr = "example.teleport.com:443"
identity = "identity"
```

Update the configuration file as follows.

{/*TODO: update the address*/}
Change `forward.fluentd.url`  to the scheme, host and port you configured for
your Universal Forwarder's `http` input earlier, `https://localhost:9601`. Change
`forward.fluentd.session-url` to the same value with the root URL path:
`https://localhost:9601/`.

Change `teleport.addr` to the host and port of your Teleport Proxy Service, or
the Auth Service if you have configured the Event Handler to connect to it
directly, e.g., `mytenant.teleport.sh:443`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Connect to the Proxy Service">

Assign `teleport.identity` to a path to the identity file you exported earlier,
e.g., `/home/auth.pem`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Connect to the Auth Service">

Assign `teleport.ca`, `teleport.cert`, and `teleport.key` to the paths of the
TLS credentials you generated earlier. Respectively, these are the certificate
authority, certificate, and private key.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Start the Event Handler

To start the Event Handler, run the following command on your Event Handler
host:

```code
$ teleport-event-handler start -d --config teleport-event-handler.toml
```

Use the `-d` flag to print debug logs and identify any issues with
starting the Event Handler. Once you have completed this guide and confirmed
that the Event Handler runs as expected, you can run the command without the
`-d` flag.

<Details title="Choose when to start exporting events">

You can configure when you would like the Event Handler to begin exporting
events when you run the `start` command. This example will start exporting from
May 5th, 2021:

```code
$ teleport-event-handler start --config teleport-event-handler.toml --start-time "2021-05-05T00:00:00Z"
```

You can only determine the start time once, when first running the Event
Handler. If you want to change the time frame later, remove the plugin state
directory that you specified in the `storage` field of the handler's
configuration file.

</Details>

Once the Event Handler starts, you will see notifications about scanned and
forwarded events:

```txt
DEBU   Event sent id:f19cf375-4da6-4338-bfdc-e38334c60fd1 index:0 ts:2022-09-21
18:51:04.849 +0000 UTC type:cert.create event-handler/app.go:140
...
```

## Step 4/4. Visualize your audit logs in Splunk
{/*TODO: Fill this in*/}

## Next steps

Now that you are exporting your audit events to Splunk, consult our [audit event
reference](../../reference/audit.mdx#event-types) so you can plan visualizations
and alerts.
